# convention, which is why the service account is that uid/gid.

# writing) exists because an unprivileged process cannot re-open this runtime's
# /dev/stdout|/dev/stderr; see nginx/run and the main nginx.conf.

# all environment variables would also eat nginx's own runtime variables ($host,
# $request_uri, ...) that the template needs intact.
#
# The CSP is not a container ENV: it ships as a file baked from upstream's web
# image (the policy hash must track the frontend), so default the variable from
# it here, where a deployer's explicit override still wins.
